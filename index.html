The DMK and its part were V. C. K. Elections of the parties of both parties have been canceled entirely  by the Election Commission of India With regard to the banning of the two parties, the ban imposed by C.B.I

Did the DMK collaborate with all the non-democratic acts against the law that has been conducted with its coalition parties? We put forward the question of the people of the country.
The Election Commission of India, who reached the tone of the unconscioned coma, replied:
In Tamil Nadu, DMK has been caught in illegal possession of Rs 32 crores and 2 crores in two places Only in Vellore if the election is stopped, all the MB elections should be canceled. Why not do that.
Did the Election Commission collaborate with DMK in illegal action? The DMK's continuous anti-aggressive acts. How much time has it been to see shame, shame, and soreness to look through the elections?
Looking. Poruppatu. Endure. Do not have a decision for this? Why the Election Commission of India does not work?
There is a cash flow and a bribe and a bribe to the cash-rich political crowd.
Thousands of cars and cars have been crowded with hundreds of millions of people.
How much money will they show on all these expenses?
These are black money from 2 Ji which is not subject to the laws of the country.
Overall, the total cost of MB election in Tamil Nadu is more than ten thousand rupees
These are all about India's democracy and society that do not call off the money transactions of the DMK against Indian sovereignty and Indian sovereignty
What is the administration of the Election Commission of India in this country?
The taxpayers of the country will have to pay a thousand rupees per thousand rupees per year?
Did the Election Commission of India collaborate with everything that happened?

There will be nothing in this country in the judiciary who will judge that there is no case. In this Indian age.  Will the Lord of the Sovereign of God look for justice and good justice? Is it possible to get rid of M.P.
The first pillar of Indian democracy is the four pillars? Answer the result.
The DMK's allies in Tamil Nadu are the last of the 18. 04. Mobilization costs that can not be accounted for in any event in the M-P. Why did the Election Commission of India look at it?
What are they doing in the elections that are illegal in Tamil Nadu?
Or there is no one to ask for anyone here. Who's the one who can only ask?
Why did the Election Commission of India conduct this?
The black money of the DMK against Indian sovereignty in the M.P.
No cash restrictions have been prevented by the people of Tamilnadu who are paying for cash.
Why was it done by the Election Commission of India in Tamil Nadu?
Why the Election Commission of India did not come forward to prevent the clutches of the DMK?
 Why were the state governments working on the Election Commission of India during the election?
The real facts are that none of the people in Tamil Nadu are selfish or self-centered, not to vote for the DMK and its allies.
Therefore, the DMK and its allies are against the Indian sovereignty and the Indian sovereignty. Election

The Election Commission of India has all M.P. Cancel the posts immediately
The re-election should be conducted only by non-governmental organizations of Tamil Nadu in the re-election.
Besides that, Karnataka is on the side. Kerala. If you use government employees such as Andhra, the DMK will be in favor of the price.
The Election Commission needs to know that elections can not be held honestly. Sources of our complaint - DMK coalition's VCK, The two crores and the Vellore DMK's main leader, Thirty two crores Furthermore, the illegal remuneration of the Tribunals should be taken into account in the Tribunals throughout Tamil Nadu. MPs across Tamil Nadu Cancel all of the elections.
The Election Commission of India has completely abolished the recognition of both the DMK and its allies  The two parties should be completely barred Why did not you do that? Is Election Commission Coming with DMK?
The DMK and its allies together collectively got Rs. The Millennium Crowns were illegally spent against Indian sovereignty It is fairly legitimate that the DMK and its coalition parties have not won as MPs
The inquiry will be explained how DMK leader Stalin's money was spent on the money spent against the Indian sovereignty in the villages.
Furthermore, the reports of the activities of the election to the district administrators and district wardens and talukas in Tamil Nadu
M.P. Black money in the election against the Indian sovereignty against Indian sovereignty and Indian law in the election The cash flows of Tamilnadu voters were bought and bought

The Election Commission of India has completely abolished the recognition of both the DMK and its allies The two parties should be completely barred. Why did Indian election commissioners do so?Did the Election Commission cooperate with DMK's frauds?
We also urge the Speaker of the Indian Parliament to maintain Indian sovereignty and maintain Indian sovereignty under the law. If the Parliament of India is sovereign and martyr? All the M.Ps of DMK and all of its allies in the choice of Tamil Nadu, which are against Indian democracy, law and sovereignty, should not be allowed in the Parliament of India. Immediately canceling their positions and thwarting the DMK and its affiliation of the two parties, the Election Commission canceled the entire election

DMK leader Stalin and his alliance party leaders immediately took legal action and held all the M.Ps of DMK and all of its allies in Tamil Nadu who were able to take action against Indian democracy, law and sovereignty.
The Parliament of India should not be allowed inside the Parliament. Immediately cancel their positions  Also, the Election Commission of India has canceled all records of the DMK The two parties should be prohibited from acting entirely.
This Complaint petition came to the hands of Indian Election Commissioners who quickly came to the hands of the CPI
The entire constitution of the two parties has also ordered the CBI to investigate all the incidents of the law and order the Indian Election Commissioner
To maintain the ability of the Indian Election Commission to maintain and maintain India's democracy and its sovereignty under Indian democracy
All the administrations mentioned above should bow down to the Election Commission of India   On our complaint, the Indian Democrats have to reassure the people of Shiva to take a firm step to ensure
their immediate action.
